# Creating a Task
Select the New Task button (if it is not visible, make sure that you have selected the dataset in the Directory)

Make sure that the result name is unique. The result name will be assigned to the newly created results dataset returned by executing the task.

After all the appropriate task parameters are entered, click on the Apply button at the bottom of the task parameters panel (you may have to scroll down).

## Generating Parameters
Most task parameters are automatically generated upon task creation. However, there are some parameters that can be manually generated. For example, the Seeding Type parameter of the Streamline Trace task can be used to generate a list of seeding points. To do this, first select the Seeding Type dropdown

Fill in the appropriate parameters and click Generate to create the new list of seeding points. (Note that this does not submit the task to the server, these generation features are only updating the task parameter itself)
